# About Me

Hello all!

My name is Christian Alicea and I am in my fourth and final year of studying Cyber Security Engineering at Iowa State University. I am originally from Montville, New Jersey and traveled here to pursue my studies in the wide and ever-expanding field of information security. This is a passion that I've been following since my junior year of high school and Iowa State has done nothing but grow my interest and allow me to learn so much more than I could've ever hoped. This school has provided me plentiful opportunites that allowed me to socialize, learn, and grow as a human. I believe that this will all be extremely useful in the coming years as I pursue a career in my field where I can use my aquired skills to protect the information of all and shut down malicious actors.

Overall, college has been a rough journey full of ups and downs, this repository is collection of some of the core expierences and opportunites I've lived through in my time at Iowa State University. In this collection you will find projects and work done starting from my freshman year of college and going all the way up to my final senior design project. Along with the showcased projects and work, I will also being sharing reflective papers where I look back at the previous years spent here and bring you along through the journey.
